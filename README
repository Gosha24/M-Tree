An M-Tree is a data structure which indexes objects according to their relative
distances. It is efficient for nearest-neighbor queries.

This implementation follows the content of the article
http://www.vldb.org/conf/1997/P426.PDF, with the following highlights:
 * The data structure is the same described in the article.
 * The algorithm for adding data had adaptations to handle with some corner cases.
 * The algorithm for removing data was designed from scratch, since it was not
 described on the article.
 * Both query algorithms (by-range and k-nearest-neighbor) were merged into one.

The only query algorithm can have as criteria either the range or the maximum
number of resulting items, or both. The algorithm processes the results as needed,
as the resulting items are fetched. The results are returned in ascending distance
from the query data parameter.

See the README-* file for each language.
